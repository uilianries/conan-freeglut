Conan is a package manager for C and C++ developers:

- It is fully decentralized. Users can host their packages in their servers, privately. Integrates with Artifactory and Bintray.
- Portable. Works across all platforms, including Linux, OSX, Windows (with native and first class support, WSL, MinGW),
  Solaris, FreeBSD, embedded and cross compiling, docker, WSL
- Manage binaries. It is able to create, upload and download binaries for any configuration and platform,
  even cross-compiling, saving lots of time in development and continuous integration. The binary compatibility
  can be configured and customized. Manage all your artifacts in exactly the same way in all platforms.
- Integrates with any build system, including any propietary and custom one. Provides tested support for major build systems
  (CMake, MSBuild, Makefiles, Meson, etc).
- Extensible: Its python based recipes, together with extensions points allows for a great power and flexibility.
- Large and active community, specially in Github (https://github.com/conan-io/conan) and Slack (https://cpplang.now.sh/ #conan channel).
  This community also create and maintains packages in Conan-center and Bincrafters repositories in Bintray.
- Stable. Used in production by many companies, since 1.0 there is a committment not to break package recipes and documented behavior.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install conan

You can also use `test.pypi.org <https://test.pypi.org/project/conan/#history>`_ repository to install development (non-stable) Conan versions:


    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ conan

You can run **conan** client and server in Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

- **Install pip following** `pip docs`_.

- **Clone conan repository:**

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ git clone https://github.com/conan-io/conan.git

- **Install in editable mode**

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ cd conan && sudo pip install -e .

  If you are in Windows, using ``sudo`` is not required.

- **You are ready, try to run conan:**

  .. code-block::

    $ conan --help

Running the tests
=================

Using tox
---------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox

It will install the needed requirements and launch `nose` skipping some heavy and slow test.
If you want to run the full test suite:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox -e full

Without tox
-----------

**Install python requirements**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r conans/requirements.txt
    $ pip install -r conans/requirements_server.txt
    $ pip install -r conans/requirements_dev.txt


Only in OSX:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r conans/requirements_osx.txt # You can omit this one if not running OSX


If you are not Windows and you are not using a python virtual environment, you will need to run these
commands using `sudo`.

Before you can run the tests, you need to set a few environment variables first.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)

On Windows it would be (while being in the conan root directory):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ set PYTHONPATH=.

Ensure that your ``cmake`` has version 2.8 or later. You can see the
version with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cmake --version

The appropriate values of ``CONAN_COMPILER`` and ``CONAN_COMPILER_VERSION`` depend on your
operating system and your requirements.

These should work for the GCC from ``build-essential`` on Ubuntu 14.04:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export CONAN_COMPILER=gcc
    $ export CONAN_COMPILER_VERSION=4.8

These should work for OS X:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export CONAN_COMPILER=clang
    $ export CONAN_COMPILER_VERSION=3.5

Finally, there are some tests that use conan to package Go-lang
libraries, so you might **need to install go-lang** in your computer and
add it to the path.

You can run the actual tests like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ nosetests .


There are a couple of test attributes defined, as ``slow``, or ``golang`` that you can use
to filter the tests, and do not execute them:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ nosetests . -a !golang

A few minutes later it should print ``OK``:

.. code-block:: bash

    ............................................................................................
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 146 tests in 50.993s

    OK

To run specific tests, you can specify the test name too, something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ nosetests conans.test.command.config_install_test:ConfigInstallTest.install_file_test --nocapture

The ``--nocapture`` argument can be useful to see some output that otherwise is captured by nosetests.
